Game Guide
Developed by: Luis Miguel Portugal Keguel, Oscar Emilio Aguirre González, Ángel Alberto Bolaños Dávila.

To start the GUI version, run "GUIJuego" and click "Start Game". Then, navigate to the village task section to assign actions. Click "Execute Tasks" to gather resources and trigger events. To create warriors, click "Barracks"; for other character types, use the "Collection Center". Raids are generated randomly.

This interface does not include ASCII animations due to implementation challenges and system performance limitations.

We also provide a terminal-based version, which can be launched directly and interacted with via a text-based menu system.
